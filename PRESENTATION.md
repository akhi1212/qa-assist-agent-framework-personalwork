## Slide 3: How It Works

# 🔄 Workflow

### Step 1: Generate Test Cases
1. Enter Jira ticket ID
2. AI analyzes ticket description
3. Generates comprehensive test cases
4. Test cases saved for future use

### Step 2: Record Browser Flow (Optional)
1. Select a test case
2. Launch browser recording
3. Perform actions in browser
4. System captures all interactions

### Step 3: Generate Playwright Code
1. System processes recorded flow or test steps
2. AI generates POM-based code
3. Code includes:
   - Locators (Python & JavaScript)
   - Reusable functions
   - Test-specific functions
   - Cursor AI integration prompt

### Step 4: Use Generated Code
- Copy locators to page classes
- Integrate functions into test suites
- Run automated tests
